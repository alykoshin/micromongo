/**
 * The core query engine — public facade.
 *
 * This module was split out of the original single-file `lib/crud/match.js` into
 * `lib/crud/match/` for modularity (Phase 9). The split is purely structural;
 * matching behavior is unchanged. The pieces:
 *
 *   registry.js   — the operator tables (pre/post/preprocess) + registerOperator()
 *   helpers.js    — _eql, _contains, the _array... family, _bits..., geo helpers
 *   engine.js     — dispatch + the mutually-recursive match()/_match1/doExpr
 *   operators/    — built-in operators, each self-registering into the registry
 *   debug.js      — the shared DEBUG trace toggle
 *
 * Requiring this module loads every operator module (so the built-ins register
 * themselves) and re-assembles the SAME public shape the old file exported:
 * a callable `match(doc, query)` with `.prepareQuery`, `.preOperators`,
 * `.postOperators`, `.projectionOps`, `._eql`, `._arrayEqlOrElementEql` —
 * plus the new `.registerOperator` (the blessed extension point).
 *
 * Adding a query operator: call `registerOperator(kind, name, fn)` (exposed as
 * `mm.registerOperator`), or add a module under `operators/` that does so and
 * require it here. New MongoDB operators still need a `-mongodoc.js` test.
 *
 * TS shape: `export = match` (the callable IS the module) typed as a `MatchFn`
 * interface (call signature + the attached statics) — the same pattern proven in
 * project.ts. Under `module:commonjs` this re-emits `module.exports = match` with
 * `module.exports.prepareQuery = …` etc., identical to the old CJS tail.
